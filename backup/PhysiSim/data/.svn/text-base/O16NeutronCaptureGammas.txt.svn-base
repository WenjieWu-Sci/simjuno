# Neutron capture gammas for O-16 generated by sums.py from data obtained from
# NNDC capture gamma tables at http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/capgam/indexbyn.html
#
# Number of gammas in a decay chain limited to 10
#
# First column lists probability for decay scheme; second column lists number of gammas
# in decay scheme; gamma energies (in keV) are then listed separated by a space.
